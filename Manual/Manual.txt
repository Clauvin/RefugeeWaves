1 - Justifying the manual

	So! A manual. What an unbelievable thing to have here, in the 21st century, where videogames, as a media, already have the capacity to show to the player through good railing how the game should be played? Why to have a manual to this game then?

	BECAUSE this is the Alpha 0 version of the game: it's not a finished game, it's a baby game: it has all the essential features, but still a long way it has to grow and become a proper adult game, ready to interact with players and give them something meaningful.

	In it's actual state, it's kinda boring, maybe buggy (even if efforts were made to squash bugs, some may be still lurking around, unseen by the developers) and maybe also hazy in how stuff works.

	Thanks to that, this manual gives a basic explanation of the game and how it works. Enjoy!

	2 - Prologue

	Ondestão. A small Republic in the middle of the foreign Algum Lugarestão region, it faces a crisis of a kind and magnitude never seen before in a long long time. And it's not alone in it. Many countries are facing a similar crisis in Europe: the refugee crisis.

	Except that for Ondestão, the country of where the refugees are fleeing from is not Syria, but Guerrestão. Guerrestão is in the middle of civil war between multiple armies, and Ondestão is neutral regarding it.

	Being neutral means also being the country that's not spending funds to have an active army, or not being directly responsible for the war atrocities. In other words, the perfect place in the refugees' minds to go to.

	The Minister of International Relations, already predicting the hardship he would face, presented his letter of leave, and scrambling to find someone ready (or at least willing to take) the task, the government found YOU.

	Yes, no looking to the side, YOU - a student of Defense and International Relations (if you aren't one, let's pretend you are, yes? Thanks!) (if you don't buy this, pretend that someone prophetized which you would be the new Minister and the prophecy became true) in a vacation in Ondestão.

	Now having to make the country ready to deal with the refugee crisis, you must answer a question: do you let the refugees enter in Ondestão? Or you block their only hope of escaping the war atrocities?
