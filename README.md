# Refugee Waves
A trainee in Defense and International Management ends stuck in another country, and to leave it, will have to deal with the refugee crisis. How will he manage the situation? Find out!

Or help us in finding out too, this is a project under construction :D

**Update:** currently pushing the project to a better proof-of-concept state. Don't know if I will work on it after that state is reached, if you want to, create a fork and send me a message.

# Origins 
Game [originally made](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/refugee-waves) by [Cláuvin Erlan](https://github.com/Clauvin), [Verônica Sakane Matias](https://github.com/vsakane) and [Brian Confessor](https://github.com/bconfessor) to the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) 2017. To call what they managed to create to the jam a game is a overstatement: it was a simulation without interactivity. But the team saw the potential in it and decided to keep working on it.
