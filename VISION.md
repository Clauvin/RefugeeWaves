# Refugee Waves' vision

The refugee crisis is a human migration event of a scale which the world wasn't prepared, and with countries having focused in the last years in security against terrorists coming from beyond borders, many Syrians faced and are still facing hardships to find safety, as their own country is in war.

One of the major obstacles for refugees is the public opinion: many believe that letting refugees enter in thir countries is equal to let criminals the opportunity to create havok, or that opening borders will make a major disruption of their economies and their cultures, and that opinion is reflected by their own governments.

As more well informed someone is, the better are their decisions. And learning by exploring and analyzing is one of the most powerful ways to understand a subject.

With this in mind, the vision for this game is for it to become a platform for experimentation about the refugee crisis scenarios: 

- How many refugees is safe to accept?
- Which are the challenges refugees face when trying to reach a safe country?
- Which problems they are facing in their own homeland? 
- And how someone can make a positive difference in this situation?
